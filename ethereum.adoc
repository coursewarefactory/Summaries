"In this chapter, you set up a wallet using MetaMask and funded it using a faucet on the Ropsten test network. You received ether into your wallet’s Ethereum address; then you sent ether to the faucet’s Ethereum address.
 Ether is subdivided into smaller units, down to the smallest unit possible, which is named wei. One ether is 1 quintillion wei (1 * 1018 or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000).
 There are some wallets that supports operations in Ethereum such as MetaMask, Jaxx, MyEtherWallet (MEW). Emerald Wallet.

"In this chapter, we provided a brief survey of public key cryptography and focused on the use of public and private keys in Ethereum and the use of cryptographic tools, such as hash functions, in the creation and verification of Ethereum addresses. We also looked at digital signatures and how they can demonstrate ownership of a private key without revealing that private key.

"There is a lot for any developer working in the smart contract domain to know and understand. By following best practices in your smart contract design and code writing, you will avoid many severe pitfalls and traps.
Perhaps the most fundamental software security principle is to maximize reuse of trusted code. In cryptography, this is so important it has been condensed into an adage: ""Don’t roll your own crypto."" In the case of smart contracts, this amounts to gaining as much as possible from freely available libraries that have been thoroughly vetted by the community.
